Please see the [upgrade guide](https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch/wiki/Migrating-to-Nightwatch-1.0) if you are upgrading from an earlier version. \n\n## 1. Install Nightwatch\n\nFrom NPM:\n```sh\n$ npm install nightwatch\n```\n\nFrom GitHub:\n```sh\n$ git clone https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch.git\n$ cd nightwatch\n$ npm install\n```\n\n## 2. Download WebDriver\n\nNightwatch uses a [WebDriver](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/) compatible server to control the browser. WebDriver is a W3C specification and industry standard which provides a platform and HTTP protocol to interact with a browser.\n   \nNightwatch includes support for automatically managing the following services:\n#### ChromeDriver \n- for running tests against the Chrome browser;\n- download url: [https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads).\n\n#### GeckoDriver\n- for running tests against the Mozilla Firefox browser;\n- download url: [https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases).\n \n#### Selenium Standalone Server \n- allows managing multiple browser configurations in one place and also to make use of the [Selenium Grid](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/Grid2) service;\n- the selenium server jar file `selenium-server-standalone-3.x.x.jar` can be downloaded from the Selenium releases page: https://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html\n\nIt's important to note that, while the Selenium Server was required with older Nightwatch versions (`v0.9` and prior), starting with version `1.0` Selenium is no longer necessary.\n\n## Setup Guides\nSpecific WebDriver setup guides can be found on the [Docs website](http://nightwatchjs.org/gettingstarted/#browser-drivers-setup). Legacy Selenium drivers setup guides along with debugging instructions can be found on the [**Wiki**](https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch/wiki).\n\n### Example tests\nVarious example tests are included in the [`examples`](https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch/tree/master/examples) folder which demonstrate the usage of several Nightwatch features. \n\n#### Example configuration\nA sample [`nightwatch.json`](https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch/blob/master/bin/nightwatch.json) config file can be found in `bin` folder.\n\n#### Nightwatch unit tests\nThe tests for Nightwatch are written using [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/).\n\nTo run the complete test suite:\n\n```sh\n$ npm test\n```\n\nTo check test coverage, run the command:\n\n```sh\n$ npm run mocha-coverage\n```\nand then open the generated _coverage/index.html_ file in your browser.\n\n## Changelog\nThe release history and changelog is available on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch/releases) page.\n\n#### Updates\nWe use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nightwatchjs) to communicate updates regarding development and to announce releases. Follow [@nightwatchjs](https://twitter.com/nightwatchjs) to get the latest or if you wish to get in touch. \n\n#### Discuss / Support\nThe [Mailing List/Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nightwatchjs) is the most appropriate tool for Nightwatch related discussions. In addition, there is a [StackOverflow Nightwatch.js tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/nightwatch.js) at your disposal.\n\n## Support Nightwatch on OpenCollective\nPlease consider supporting Nightwatch by becoming a backer on the [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/nightwatch/) platform.\n\n[![Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/nightwatch/tiers/backers.svg?avatarHeight=60)](https://opencollective.com/nightwatch/contribute/tier/7349-backers)\n",
