The "ideal" or "use case" screenshot is stored here. The first time tests are run, screenshot is taken and stored here
since it depends on computer to computer what the "ideal" screenshot looks like i.e minor changes in
resolution or color can produce false negatives, platform dependent. Therefore, I pushed this folder 
empty so that each user creates their own ideal screenshot.
If running both chrome and IE, chrome finishes first and posts in this directory and as such, IE will
try and compare to chrome screenshots producing errors.
